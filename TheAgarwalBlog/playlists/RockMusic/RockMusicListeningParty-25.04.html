      <h2 class="song-credit">Led Zeppelin</h2>
      <h3 class="song-meta">Album "Led Zeppelin IV", 1971</h3>
      <p class="song-lyrics">
          There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
          And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
          When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
          With a word she can get what she came for
          Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
          There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
          'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
          In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
          Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
          Ooh, it makes me wonder
          Ooh, makes me wonder
          There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
          And my spirit is crying for leaving
          In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
          And the voices of those who stand looking
          Ooh, it makes me wonder
          Ooh, really makes me wonder
          And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
          Then the piper will lead us to reason
          And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
          And the forests will echo with laughter
          Oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa
          If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
          It's just a spring clean for the May queen
          Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
          There's still time to change the road you're on
          And it makes me wonder
          Ohh, whoa
          Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
          The piper's calling you to join him
          Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
          Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
          And as we wind on down the road
          Our shadows taller than our soul
          There walks a lady we all know
          Who shines white light and wants to show
          How everything still turns to gold
          And if you listen very hard
          The tune will come to you at last
          When all are one, and one is all
          To be a rock and not to roll
          And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

        And I feel that time's a wasted go
        So where you goin' 'til tomorrow?
        And I see that these are lies to come
        So would you even care?
        And I feel it
        And I feel it
        Where you goin' for tomorrow?
        Where you goin' with the mask I found?
        And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
        Will she smell alone?
        And I feel so much depends on the weather
        So, is it rainin' in your bedroom?
        And I see that these are the eyes of disarray
        So would you even care?
        And I feel it
        And she feels it
        Where you goin' for tomorrow?
        Where you goin' with the mask I found?
        And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
        Will she smell alone?
        When the dogs do find her
        Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
        To find it, to find it, to find it
        When the dogs do find her
        Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
        To find it, to find it, to find it
        Where you goin' for tomorrow?
        Where you goin' with the mask I found?
        And I feel, and I feel when the dogs begin to smell her
        Will she smell alone?
        When the dogs do find her
        Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
        To find it, to find it, to find it
        When the dogs do find her
        Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
        To find it, to find it, to find it
        To find it
        To find it
        To find it

      <h3 class="song-meta">Album "Fallen", 2003</h3>
      <p class="song-lyrics">Now I will tell you what I've done for you
        50 thousand tears I've cried
        Screaming, deceiving, and bleeding for you
        And you still won't hear me (going under)
        Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself
        Maybe I'll wake up for once (wake up for once)
        Not tormented, daily defeated by you
        Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom
        I'm dying again
        I'm going under (going under)
        Drowning in you (drowning in you)
        I'm falling forever (falling forever)
        I've got to break through
        I'm going under
        Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
        (So I don't know what's real)
        So I don't know what's real and what's not
        (Don't know what's real and what's not)
        Always confusing the thoughts in my head (ooh)
        So I can't trust myself anymore
        I'm dying again
        I'm going under (going under)
        Drowning in you (drowning in you)
        I'm falling forever (falling forever)
        I've got to break through
        I'm...
        So go on and scream
        Scream at me, I'm so far away (so far away)
        I won't be broken again (again)
        I've got to breathe, I can't keep going under
        I'm dying again
        I'm going under (going under)
        Drowning in you (drowning in you)
        I'm falling forever (falling forever)
        I've got to break through
        I'm going under (going under)
        Going under (drowning in you)
        I'm going under
