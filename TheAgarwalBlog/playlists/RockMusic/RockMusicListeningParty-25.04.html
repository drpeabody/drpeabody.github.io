      <h2 class="song-credit">Led Zeppelin</h2>
      <h3 class="song-meta">Album "Led Zeppelin IV", 1971</h3>
      <p class="song-lyrics">
          There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
          And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
          When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
          With a word she can get what she came for
          Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
          There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
          'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
          In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
          Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
          Ooh, it makes me wonder
          Ooh, makes me wonder
          There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
          And my spirit is crying for leaving
          In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
          And the voices of those who stand looking
          Ooh, it makes me wonder
          Ooh, really makes me wonder
          And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
          Then the piper will lead us to reason
          And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
          And the forests will echo with laughter
          Oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa
          If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
          It's just a spring clean for the May queen
          Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
          There's still time to change the road you're on
          And it makes me wonder
          Ohh, whoa
          Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
          The piper's calling you to join him
          Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
          Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
          And as we wind on down the road
          Our shadows taller than our soul
          There walks a lady we all know
          Who shines white light and wants to show
          How everything still turns to gold
          And if you listen very hard
          The tune will come to you at last
          When all are one, and one is all
          To be a rock and not to roll
          And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

        Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
        To find it, to find it, to find it
        When the dogs do find her
        Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
        To find it, to find it, to find it

        Now I will tell you what I've done for you
        50 thousand tears I've cried
        Screaming, deceiving, and bleeding for you
        And you still won't hear me (going under)
        Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself
        Maybe I'll wake up for once (wake up for once)
        Not tormented, daily defeated by you
        Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom
        I'm dying again
        I'm going under (going under)
        Drowning in you (drowning in you)
        I'm falling forever (falling forever)
        I've got to break through
        I'm going under
        Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
        (So I don't know what's real)
        So I don't know what's real and what's not
        (Don't know what's real and what's not)
        Always confusing the thoughts in my head (ooh)
        So I can't trust myself anymore
        I'm dying again
        I'm going under (going under)
        Drowning in you (drowning in you)
        I'm falling forever (falling forever)
        I've got to break through
        I'm...
        So go on and scream
        Scream at me, I'm so far away (so far away)
        I won't be broken again (again)
        I've got to breathe, I can't keep going under
        I'm dying again
        I'm going under (going under)
        Drowning in you (drowning in you)
        I'm falling forever (falling forever)
        I've got to break through

        D'you breathe the name of your saviour
        In your hour of need?
        And taste the blame if the flavor
        Should remind you of greed
        Of implication, insinuation, and ill-will
        'Til you cannot lie still
        In all this turmoil, before red cape and foil
        Come closing in for a kill
        Come feed the rain
        'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
        Dancing underneath the skies of lust
        Yeah, feed the rain
        'Cause without your love, my life
        Ain't nothing but this carnival of rust, oh
        It's all a game, avoiding failure
        When true colors will bleed
        All in the name of misbehavior
        And the things we don't need
        I lust for after, no disaster can touch
        Touch us anymore
        And more than ever, I hope to never fall
        Where enough is not the same it was before
        Come feed the rain
        'Cause I'm thirsty for your love
        Dancing underneath the skies of lust
        Yeah, feed the rain
        'Cause without your love, my life

        Don't walk away, oh, when the world is burning
        Don't walk away
        Don't walk away, oh, when the heart is yearning
        Don't walk away
        Don't walk away, oh, when the world is burning

        You gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people
        We're so happy we can hardly count
        Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?

        I got my first real six-string
        Bought it at the Five and Dime
        Played it 'til my fingers bled
        Was the summer of '69

        Me and some guys from school
        Had a band and we tried real hard
        Jimmy quit, Jody got married
        Should've known we'd never get far

        Oh, when I look back now
        That summer seemed to last forever
        And if I had the choice
        Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
        Those were the best days of my life

        Hey!

        Ain't no use in complainin'

        Spent my evenings down at the drive-in
        And that's when I met you, yeah
        
        Standin' on your mama's porch

        Those were the best days of my life

        Oh, yeah
        Back in the summer of '69, oh

        Man, we were killin' time
        We were young and restless
        We needed to unwind
        I guess nothing can last forever
        Forever, no!

        Yeah! Yeah!

        And now the times are changin'
        Look at everything that's come and gone
        Sometimes when I play that old six-string
        Think about you, wonder what went wrong
        Standin' on your mama's porch
        You told me that it'd last forever
        Oh, and when you held my hand
        I knew that it was now or never
        Those were the best days of my life

        Oh, yeah
        Back in the summer of '69, uh-huh
        It was the summer of '69, oh, yeah

        Please allow me to introduce myself
        I'm a man of wealth and taste
        I've been around for a long, long year
        Stole many a man's soul and faith
        And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
        Had his moment of doubt and pain
        Made damn sure that Pilate
        Washed his hands and sealed his fate

        Hope you guess my name

        I stuck around St. Petersberg
        When I saw it was a time for a change
        I killed the Czar and his ministers
        Anastasia screamed in vain
        I rode a tank

        Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
        What's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah
        I watched with glee as your kings and queens
        Fought for ten decades
        For the Gods they made
        I shouted out
        "Who killed the Kennedy?"
        When after all
        It was you and me
        So let me please introduce myself
        I'm a man of wealth and taste

        Pleased to meet you
        Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah
        But what's puzzling you is just the nature of my game
        Just as every cop is a criminal
        And all the sinners saints
        As heads is tails just call me Lucifer
        'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
        So if you meet me
        Have some courtesy
        Have some sympathy, and some taste
        Use all your well-learned politesse?
        Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah
