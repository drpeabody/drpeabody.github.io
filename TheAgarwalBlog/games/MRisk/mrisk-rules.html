# MRisk Game Rules


MRisk is a risk inspired game made only on HTML and JS. It runs in your web browser and does not need to install anything.  
A game of Risk involves territories captured by players, investing into the territories and capturing enemy territories.  
Each player has capital territories, which when captured by another player, automatically eliminates the player whose capital is captured.  

## Starting the Game

The game starts with only two Players: Red, and Green.  
There is a map serving as a board on which these two players will play the game.  
On the Map there are several territories, some in dark grey and some in light grey.

### Choosing Capital cities

The first step for each player is to select two capital territories each.  
This happens alternatively, starting with Red.  
Out of all the territories, the game randomly selects 10 territories, highlights them in light grey color.  
Red can choose any one of these light grey territories to be their capital.  
A capital city is denoted by a bright boundary around the territory with their color.

### Initial Territorial Assignment

After the Red and Green players have each chosen two capital territories each, the game will automatically calculate the remaining 
unassigned (grey) territories, shuffle them in a random order and assign half of them to Green and the other half to Red.  
This means out of the 40 total territories, 4 being chosen as capitals, the remaining 36 get divided evenly 
between Red and Green, both of them getting 18 territories each always.

### State of the game at the beginning

After the capital cities are selected, each player starts with 24 units of gold.
The HUD on the right completes itself:
1. Color reflects the current player, Red or Green
2. Gold Pile Number reflects the current gold pile, which can be used to add armies to a player's territories
3. Capital Cities' names of the current player
4. Total Number of zones owned by the player currently
5. Reminder of the cost of armies when adding armies to a player's territories

## Playing the Game

After the capital cities are selected, the player gets 3 actions, the main gameplay loop:

### Action 1: Add Armies

Players can choose to add armies to their territories by pressing the "Add" button at the bottom of the HUD.  
Armies are of three kinds: Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery.  
Players can choose any amount of armies to add into any owned territories.
To add armies, press the yellow "Add" button on the bottom of the HUD, then select which kind of army you wish you add,
then select which territory you want to add the armies to. The territory you select has to be owned by you, meaning, Red
can only add armies to Red territories and vice versa.

When you add armies, the corresponding price is calculated and deducted from your gold pile.  
A player can choose to add as many armies as many times as they can afford every turn.


### Action 2: Attack Territories

Players can choose to attack any enemy territory initiating an attack from one of the neighbour territories that they own.
There are 3 conditions for a valid attack:
1. The initiating territory must be owned by the current player
2. The attack target territory must be owned by the enemy 
3. The initiating territory and target territory must be neighbours on the map.  
Each territory has at most 8 neighbours when surrounded on all sides.
