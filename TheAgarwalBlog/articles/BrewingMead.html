# Brewing Mead DIY


| Ingredients        | Equipment           |
| :------------ |:--------------| 
| Fermentation Jar (E1)  | 3.8 L of fresh water (I1) | 
| Air Lock (E2)    | 1.4 kg of honey (I2)      | 
| Hydrometer (E3)   | 1 gram of white wine yeast (I3)    | 
| Filter Cloth (E4) | ~25 grams of fresh herbs (I4)  |
|    |   Yeast (Included) (I5) |

For the herbs, ingredient I4, note the following:  
a. Make sure no woody parts of plants like barks are used  
b. If you are using fruits, use only the flesh of fruits and discard the peel  
c. If you are using dried  

## Sterilize all your equipment by 

1. Spraying dilute acids or,  
2. Rinsing with vinegar or,  
3. Boiling all equipments in water for 3-5 mins  

## Prepare the initial mixture (Must) for fermentation

1. Bring the 3.8 L water (I1) to a boil to sterilize it  
2. Add the boiled water (I1) to the sterilized fermentation Jar (E1)  
3. Let the water (I1) in the Fermentation Jar (E1) cool down to hot from boiling.
Adding honey to boiling water may change its taste.
4. Add the honey (I2) slowly and keep stirring the mixture to completely dissolve the honey.
It is important that a complete homogenous mixture is formed and no honey settles down at the bottom.  
5. Add the spices (I4) to this mixture. If you crush/pulverize the spices, they may
take over the flavour of honey completely and also affect the final color of the mead.
For only a hint of flavour, add the spices solid.  
6. Stir the mixture thoroughly. This mixture before fermentation is called **Must**.

## Do some Hocus Phocus

1. Measure the Relative Density (Specific Gravity) of the Must. This is the baseline measurement 
which will be used later on to calculate the alcohol content of the Mead. Generally this is between 1.060 and 1.120.
2. Check the flavour profile of the Must and make notes for reference and measuring how the taste
changes after fermentation.

## Fermentation itself

1. Use about 1 gram of the Yeast (I5) and sprinkle it over the Must mixture. This is enough for 4 L of Must.
Adding too much yeast will only make the process go much faster, but will not affect the taste of
the final Mead by a lot.
2. Thoroughly stir the mixture to distribute the yeast evenly.
3. Cap the fermentation jar (E1) and make sure the lid is tight.
4. Attach the airlock (E2) at the top and to make sure the hole is airtight, fill the crater in the lid where 
the airlock receiver hole is with water. This will make guarantee that the airlock hole is not leaking any air.
Mead does not usually require an air tight container, but making it air tight increases the quality of fermentation.
5. Put a few drops of water into the U-Tube of the airlock (E2), so as to forbid the inflow of air, but allow
the outflow of air in case pressure builds up inside the fermentation jar (E1).
6. Stir the mixture once or twice a day for the first 48 hours. This just makes sure that yeast colonies are
even more evenly spread out.

## The Period of Waiting and Observation

1. Fermentation will begin soon after yeast is added. As the fermentation happens, the sugar in the Must is
metabolized by the yeast and converted into alcohol. Since alcohol has a lower density than water,
the relative density of the solution will keep dropping until fermentation stops.
2. The yeast will produce metabolic waste which shows up as residue at the bottom of the jar. While not 
harmful to consume, the residue will have affect the taste of the final Mead.
3. You can try to siphon the Mead into another sterilized container to get rid of the residue once or twice 
during the fermentation process.

## Bottling and Final Measurements

1. Remove or filter the Sediment by any of the following methods:  
    a. Sedimentation & Decantation with the filter cloth (E4) provided. In this case transfer the liquid slowly to reduce bubbles.  
    b. Siphoning into a new sterilized Jar, in this case siphon the bottom Mead first in order to reduce the
    exposure to oxygen. This is because alcohol gets converted into vinegar in presence of oxygen over time.  
2. Once again sterilize the Hydrometer and measure the Relative Density of the Mead.  
    a. Dry tasting mead will read between 0.099 to 1.006.  
    b. Medium tasting mead that is slightly sweet and slightly dry will read between 1.006 to 1.015.  
    c. Sweet mead will fall between 1.012 to 1.020.  
    d. Very sweet dessert mead will read anywhere past 1.02.  
The drop in relative density can be used along with the initial baseline relative density to calculate the 
alcohol by volume in the Mead (ABV)

And you are done!
You can consume the Mead for upto 2 years!

## Points to remember for Safe Consumption

### A note on Methanol Formation

Make sure you are adding as little woody substances to the Must mixture before fermentation.
The reason is that woody things are mainly composed of plant cells which contain a substance called pectin.
This is one of the proteins that gives wood it's structural strength.
While sugar gets metabolized to ethanol by yeast (which is what we want),
pectin can get metabolized to methanol (this is poisonous).
This happens when the fermenting yeast has a specific mutation, most wine yeasts have this mutation.
Methanol gets metabolized into formaldehyde and formic acid in our liver and is extremely toxic
to our liver and our neural systems. 
One good thing is that drinking ethanol is an antidote to methanol poisoning, because ethanol can bind 
and dissolve the methanol in our systems making it harmless.
Home brewing will inevitably involve trace amounts of methanol, but with a good volume of ethanol 
present in homebrew mixtures, the risk is microscopic.
But still, just to be sure, avoid adding woody substances to the Must mixture before fermentation.

## Calculating Alcohol By Volume (ABV) Value

For basic measurement, we measure two values of relative density, one before and one after fermentation.  
Alcohol By Volume is given by 
$$ \frac{76.08 * (BaseRD - FinalRD)} { (1.775 - baseRD) } \times \frac{FinalRD} {0.794} $$
How did this formula come about? Perhaps Stochiometry. It would be cool find out.
