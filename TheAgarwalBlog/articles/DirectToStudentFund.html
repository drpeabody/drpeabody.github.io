# The Importance of Student Activities

Recently when I visited IIT Hyderabad I met with some of the final year students.
I believe a lack of variety in Student Activities is leading to a stagnation in the growth of student communities.
It goes without saying that when students who have been busy with the preparations of entrance exams 
for multiple years suddenly find themselves with a lot of time on their hands, there is an immediate 
need to provide them with a variety of options of communities which are focussed on constructive activies.
This way the students always have some communities to engage in, even if they are not interested in 
traditional skills such as sports or programming.

For students which are not interested in taking part in traditional activities like programming and sports, 
it becomes extremely hard to argue why they should engage with anybody at all in a university outside of 
their class curriculum. This builds a negative loop which is not only harmful for the mental health of the
student, it further dampens the motivations of other communities (even traditional communities) who are 
trying to engage with students and provide them with constructive directions.

## 1 What I want to do

To this end, I want to establish a recurring effort as an Alumni of IIT Hyderabad, to establish a 
channel for procuring funding for any student activity that they wish to do. There are three things 
which should be varifyable for everyone including public in order to ensure
a positive operation of this channel of direct student funding:

### 1.1 Open Access to Donation Information
That anyone from the public be able to verify the donations made to this channel  

### 2.1 Open Access to Funding Information
That anyone from the public be able to verify the funds which were provided to the students, including 
the student they were given to and why  

### 3.1 Funding Accountability and Fair Use of Funding
That anyone from the public be able to verify, that to as far as possible, that the funds were used 
for a constructive student activity and not for personal or exclusive expenses and gatherings

## 2 Process 

### 2.1 Funding Request
Any student activity can be planned and apply for a funding of less than 5000 INR via a Google Form. 
This will collect the following information in writing from the organizer student:  
    a. The Name, Roll Number, (IITH) Email Id and Phone Number of the Organizing student  
    b. The reason the funding is required with details including date of event  
    c. Any student Club affiliations is present  
    d. A reasonable estimate of the amount of funds required

### 2.2 Making Expenses
The Direct to Student fund will provide an estimate of the amount of funds it will be able to secure
in response to the funding request. The student can go ahead and make the expense while keeping these 
two things for record:  
    a. A Proof of Expenditure  
    b. A Proof of Student Benefit  

### 2.3 Expense Reimbursement
Based on the funds raised and funding requests, an expense 
reimbursement will be made and the following details will be stored in an open access public 
place:  
a. The details of Funding Request listed under the section **2.1 Funding Request**  
b. The Proof of Expenditure provided by the organizing student  
c. The Proof of Student Benefit provided by the organizing student  
d. The Proof of Fund Transfer to the organizing student  

### 2.4 Rasing Funds
All donations will be recorded in a open access public place so that anyone can verify the funds 
which are raised by this channel.

## 3 Beginning Small

To ensure a reliable safety in operation, I plan to open this fund initially for only two purposes:

### 3.1 Food at Student Activities

a. In this case, a student organizer is required to provide the bills (Eg. bill from Dominoes or bill 
from Sampoorna for sweets, snacks etc) as **2.2a Proof of Expenditure**  
b. The student organizer is also required to provide more than one photopgraph with the benefactor 
students and the food that was purchased from this funding as **2.2b Proof of Student Benefit**

### 3.2 Prize Money for Student Activities

a. In this case, a student organizer is required to provide the identity information of Prize Money 
winners along with the amounf of prize money won by each winner  
b. For **2.2b Proof of Student Benefit**, this channel will pay the winners declared directly by the
organizing student. This channel will maintain a written record of the winners declared by the organizing 
student to prove an inclusive and impersonal benefit to students
