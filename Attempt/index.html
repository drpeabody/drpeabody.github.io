      <h5 class="w3-center">Spreading Happiness since 16 Oct, 1995</h5>
      <p class="w3-large"> This beauty was found by many to be the source of their own happiness and stability. To say that
      	she deserves all the love and care that people offer her is truly and understatement. The sheer magnitude of hard 
        work, emotional strength, courage and caring God had to put in her meant that God took a short vacation to restore 
        Their strength. <br>
        And of course the day she isn't smiling, it seems the sun doesn't 
        want to show up.</p>

      <h4>A Truck Load of Hardwork</h4>
      <p > Started earning the youngest in her family, her legends of hardwork are hidden from none.</p><br>
    
      <h4>The Most Intense and Fulfilling Love</h4>
      <p > Well, once she decides she loves you, you can't escape that easy, nor can you try and stop yourself from loving her.</p><br>
    
      <h4>God Like Beauty</h4>
      <p > Even the most skilled Romans and Greek cannot chisel a marble like her curves, nor can the most talented 
      Hura_Italian find a DSLR picture which does true justice to her beauty.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Unending Overflow of Support</h4>
      <p >She can support you every second of the day and every day of the week, you won't even have to ask.</p><br>
    
      <h4>Meteor bearing Responsibility</h4>
      <p >With her in the party, nothing can ever go wrong, all cabs are always negotiated, all friends are always returned home safely.
      If she is around, you can relax like an 8 year old in his own home.</p>
